Job Title:
CSV/Data Manipulation Specialist + React Analytics Dashboard Builder


Job Description:

We are looking for a data manipulation specialist to help on our analytics dashboard project.

Each month we download CSV files from an external company and use the data to create an analytics/reporting dashboard for our clients.

We do not have API access to this data.

We would like someone to take our CSV files and write a script to transform the data and write it to our MySQL database.
This script will be code that we can run each month on the new CSV files that we download.

The data will then be used to create a React dashboard which will visualize the data. The data will be filterable on certain dimensions.

You will be provided with a mockup of the desired end product.





Proposal:

please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Liam and I have over 20 years experience working as a full stack developer.

I have extensive experience with both server side and front end technologies including

* Databases (SQL and MySQL) - 20 years
stored procedures, ETL, database design, reporting, performance, denormalising for reporting, security

* Server / Web API - 15 years
Web api development including authentication, authorization (JWT tokens), performance, caching, intuitive routing, swagger and so on.
Although I do not have extensive experience with Python, I could easily develop database ETL tools and a web API using it.
(I would NOT charge for my time learning Python).
I have some much more experience building web apis with C#. However if Python is your preferred solution that would not be a problem.

* Front End
React / Material UI including charting and reporting.
Extensive experience with HTML, CSS, Tailwind, React, Routing, caching, MaterialUI, Data Visualisation (D3.js), charting components and so on.
I deliver highly performant systems on the front end.

Some small examples of my work:
* Simple ReactJS/Material UI dashboard that I am currently working on:

I am available 20 hours per week and could easily develop a front to back solution for you.

If you are interested we could chat over zoom (liam.grossmann@protonmail.com) so that I can better understand your requirements. Thereafter I will document a proposed technical design / architecture with a planned schedule for your consideration (free of charge). Once we agree the terms of the plan we could move forward.

I have delivered amazing systems for clients for over 20 years. I guarantee you will not be dissappointed.

Liam
